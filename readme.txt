This application is used to analyze and organize the results of the candidates who attended the 
First Semester Regular Exam for BCA under Kannur University, 2019 Admission Onwards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEPS:
1. Place all the results PDFs in the 'Reservoir' folder.
2. Run the program 'SourceCode.py'.
3. After completion you will get an MS Excel file 'S1BCA.xlsx'. Open to see the analyzed output.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES:
1. The program will automatically arrange the data in ascending order according to the register number of the candidates.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
1. The program  won't run properly if the 'S1BCA.xlsx' file is open in MS Excel. Close MS Excel, re-run the program, and open 'S1BCA.xlsx' after completion.
2. The original PDF download should be placed in the 'Reservoir' folder, regardless of whatever filename. Don't place image format files (screenshots) or PDF files of the image file. Any variation in the file will result in improper functioning of the application.
3. This application can only be used to arrange First Semester BCA Regular exams after 2019 admission. Results PDFs before 2019 will show errors. Exam result PDFs of other departments should not be placed. Improvement or Supplementary exam result PDFs of even the same department should not be placed.
